Changelog
=========

Unreleased
----------

- Added synthetic demo tasks in ``data/tasks/created`` and a ``scripts/run_synth_demo.py`` helper to exercise the synth-ai dataset concurrently while reporting individual and aggregate scores.
- Updated the synth-ai dataset wiring to resolve path discovery/cache issues and ignore tracking of non-README Markdown docs via ``.gitignore``.
